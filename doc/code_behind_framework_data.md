## CodeBehind framework data

CodeBehind framework creates a directory named code_behind in the project directory after the first execution.

There are the following files in the code_behind directory:
 - dll_import_list.ini
 - namespace_import_list.ini
 - options.ini
 - views_class.cs
 - views_class_last_success_compiled.cs
 - views_compile_error.log (maybe)
 - views_class_aggregation_error.log (maybe)

Apart from the list above, a file called CodeBehindLastSuccessCompiled.dll.tmp is added next to the CodeBehind.dll library and the main project dll.
