## CodeBehind framework vs Code-Behind pattern

Code-behind is a programming pattern that separates the presentation logic from the HTML code that allowing for a cleaner separation of concerns. It involves creating a separate class file for the code, which can help with maintainability and readability. Code-Behind contribute to maintaining code quality and readability.

The Elanat team introduces the framework created by itself as CodeBehind and calls the coding structure for the complete separation of the server part codes from the design part Code-Behind (uses the dash character to separate Code and Behind). If the name CodeBehind is confusing for you, you can call it Elanat CodeBehind or Elanat CodeBehind framework!

Common people usually know Code-Behind with Microsoft web-form. Please note that the CodeBehind framework is one of the most powerful and modern back-end frameworks and its structure has nothing to do with Microsoft's former web-form.
