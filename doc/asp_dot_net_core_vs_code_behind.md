## ASP.NET Core VS CodeBehind; why should we use CodeBehind?

![Why should we use CodeBehind](https://github.com/elanatframework/Code_behind/assets/111444759/e3e7929b-a4af-43b8-a178-20bf8e79a4d0)

Many developers avoid ASP.NET Core and choose interpretive frameworks like Django and Laravel. And this is due to the complexities and weak default structure of ASP.NET Core and the need for complex configurations and controller classes with a chaotic and incomprehensible structure for novice programmers, as well as the difficulty of building a modular system.

CodeBehind stores the final values of its pages outside of the Response in the HttpContext; you can edit the output of the final values in the aspx pages before the answer. This gives you more control than ASP.NET Core.

CodeBehind produces understandable code, while the Controller part of ASP.NET Core is a messy and complex situation.

You will never experience the power that the CodeBehind framework gives you in ASP.NET Core.

.NET developers accept CodeBehind as part of the larger .NET ecosystem. Whatever benefits CodeBehind has belongs to the .NET community.

CodeBehind is similar to interpreted frameworks such as Django and Laravel, and programmers of interpreted programming language projects can easily program with CodeBehind.

Developers of interpretative frameworks can consider CodeBehind as an alternative.

 ### CodeBehind advantages

CodeBehind is a flexible framework. CodeBehind inherits all the advantages of ASP.NET Core and gives it more simplicity, power and flexibility.

CodeBehind, like the default ASP.NET Core, supports multiple platforms, and in the test conducted by the Elanat team, it also has high stability on Linux.

CodeBehind occupies less memory resources (ram) than ASP.NET Core.

aspx pages are compiled in CodeBehind and their calling is done at a very high speed, so that the path of the aspx file is not even referred to during the calling.

Really, no matter what we tried, we couldn't find any advantages to using ASP.NET Core compared to CodeBehind; perhaps if we were to compare ASP.NET Core with frameworks such as Django and Laravel, we could introduce high execution speed and leading programming language C# as a measure of ASP.NET Core's superiority; but using CodeBehind will give us the same advantages.

### Elanat was created using CodeBehind

CodeBehind is a stable and reliable framework; [Elanat](https://elanat.net) is the most powerful .NET system implemented using the CodeBehind framework.
