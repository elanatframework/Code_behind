## ASP.NET Core VS CodeBehind; why should we use CodeBehind?

![Why should we use CodeBehind](https://github.com/elanatframework/Code_behind/assets/111444759/e3e7929b-a4af-43b8-a178-20bf8e79a4d0)

Many developers avoid ASP.NET Core and choose interpretive frameworks like Django and Laravel. And this is due to the complexities and weak default structure of ASP.NET Core and the need for complex configurations and controller classes with a chaotic and incomprehensible structure for novice programmers, as well as the difficulty of building a modular system.

Really, no matter what we tried, we couldn't find any advantages to using ASP.NET Core compared to CodeBehind; perhaps if we were to compare ASP.NET Core with frameworks such as Django and Laravel, we could introduce high execution speed and leading programming language C# as a measure of ASP.NET Core's superiority; but using CodeBehind will give us the same advantages.
