# Code_behind
This library is a programming model based on the MVC structure, which provides the possibility of creating dynamic aspx files (similar to standard .NET) in .NET Core and has high Serverside independence.
Soon we will expand this project so that in future versions you can experience both MVC and Code-Behind without coding in the view.
