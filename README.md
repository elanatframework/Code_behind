# Code_behind
CodeBehind library is a backend framework. This library is a programming model based on the MVC structure, which provides the possibility of creating dynamic aspx files (similar to .NET Standard) in .NET Core and has high serverside independence.
CodeBehind framework supports standard syntax and Razor syntax. This framework guarantees the separation of server-side codes from the design part (html) and there is no need to write server-side codes in the view.

**The CodeBehind framework is faster than the default structure of cshtml pages in ASP.NET Core.**

**CodeBehind is .NET Diamond!**

In every scenario, CodeBehind performs better than the default structure in ASP.NET Core.

Programming in CodeBehind is simple. The simplicity of the CodeBehind project is the result of two years of study and research on back-end frameworks and how they support web parts.

###  CodeBehind story 
First, CodeBehind was supposed to be a back-end framework for the C++ programming language; our project in C++ was going well, we built the listener structure and we were even able to implement fast-cgi in the coding phase for the Windows operating system. Windows operating system test with nginx web server was very stable and fast; but for some reason, we stopped working and implemented CodeBehind on .NET Core version 7.

### Download CodeBehind

We added CodeBehind in Nuget so that you can access it easily. You can use it in:

[https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodeBehind](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodeBehind)

### Elanat was created using CodeBehind

CodeBehind is a stable and reliable framework; [Elanat](https://elanat.net) is the most powerful .NET system implemented using the CodeBehind framework.
